Meshmagick User's Guide (|version|)
===================================

**Meshmagick** is a command line utility as well as a python module for the manipulation of meshes encountered in the
hydrodynamics community.

Its primary goal was to be a conversion tool between major file formats for hydrodynamic computations tools (Nemoh,
Wamit, Hydrostar or Diodore) and visualization tools (stl, Tecplot, Paraview). It will be particularly useful for code
to code comparisons or benchmarking.

**Meshmagick** also comes with several mesh manipulation capabilities: translation, rotation, scaling, clipping by a
plane, symmetry, normals flipping, normals healing (making them consistent across the mesh and outgoing), cleaning
(duplicate nodes merging...).

As of the release 1.0, **meshmagick** provides useful options for hydrostatics computations. It can solve for
hydrostatics equilibrium for a given mass, center of gravity or both and provide the clipped mesh to be used by BEM
software as well as the hydrostatics parameters (stiffness matrix, position of the center of buoyancy, displacement,
draft...).

**Meshmagick** is primarily a command line utility for everyday hydrodynamicists. However, it also comes with a
package that can be imported in a python script and give the full access to the command line options, programmatically.
