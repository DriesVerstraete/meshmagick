MESHMAGICK
==========

MESHMAGICK is a command line utility as well as a python module for the manipulation
of meshes encountered in the hydrodynamics community. Its name comes from its
resemblance with the functionality of the excellent image related ImageMagick.

The primary usage of MESHMAGICK is its conversion functionality between major
mesh file formats used for hydrodynamic computations (BEM software for seakeeping)
and visualisation (Tecplot, Paraview). The goal is here to ease interoperability
between software and benchmarking studies.

As a bonus, some other basic manipulation options allow to manipulate meshes
(translate, rotate, scale) and to clean them (duplicate nodes merging, renumbering...).
