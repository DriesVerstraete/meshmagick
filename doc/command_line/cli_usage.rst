Using Meshmagick
================

.. note::

    * Mesh files examples used through this page are available under the `meshmagick/tests/data` directory so that you
      can play with them.
    * Images that illustrate the examples have been obtained with the Meshmagick's viewer and by pressing the ``c``
      keystroke.
    * Most of the command line options may be combined.

Getting help
------------

You can get command line help by issuing the following command::

    >$ meshmagick -h

The output of this command is reproduced in the :any:`Command Line Interface Reference Guide <cli_reference>`.

Converting a mesh file
----------------------

Converting a mesh file is one of the most basic usage of Meshmagick::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -o SEAREV.mar

The format of the file is generally guessed from the extensions. However, sometimes the extension may not be explicit
enough to guess the file format. You should then use the :abbr:`-ifmt (--input-format)` and
:abbr:`-ofmt (--output-format)` options to explicitly declare the file format::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -ifmt paraview SEAREV.vtp -ofmt nemoh SEAREV.dat

This way, we told Meshmagick that SEAREV.dat should be in the
`Nemoh <https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/doku.php/emo/nemoh/start>`_ input mesh file format.

Quiet mode
----------

To switch off outputs of Meshmagick, use the :abbr:`-q (--quiet)` option::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -q

Getting information on a mesh
-----------------------------

Quick information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick information on a mesh is given by the :abbr:`-i (--info)` option::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -i

That gives us the following output:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp -i


Mesh quality metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get some quality metrics on the mesh by issuing::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp --quality

that gives:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp --quality

.. note::

    This option requires that you have an installed version of the python VTK library as it is used to compute these
    metrics. It relies on the verdict library, initially developed at Sandia lab and late included into VTK. More
    information on the metrics can be seen in the
    `Verdict manual <http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/6/6b/VerdictManual-revA.pdf>`_.

Mesh file visualization
-----------------------

Quickly viewing a mesh can be achieved by using the following command::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp --show

that opens the internal Meshmagick's viewer.

.. image:: ../img/viewer.png

.. note::

    The viewer relies on VTK, so the python VTK library must be installed in order to use it.

The viewer is blazing fast and support mesh manipulation with the mouse. Some keyboard keys are available and their
usage is indicated in the upper right panel.

Certainly the most useful feature is teh visualization of normals by pressing the ``n`` keystroke so that you can verify
consistency of normals across the mesh as well as orientation (must generally be outward for computations).

.. image:: ../img/viewer_options.png

The above screenshot has been obtained by pressing successively the keys ``n`` (showing normals), ``w`` (wire
representation), ``h`` (show Oxy plane i.e. the water free surface) and ``c`` (to save a screnshot that is saved
under the name ``screenshot.png`` in the current working directory.)

**Just play with options to discover what is available !**

.. note::

    The frame at the lower left corner is draggable and resizable so that you can inspect your mesh for alignment or
    whatever you want.

Mesh healing
------------

Meshmagick offers some options to deal with mesh description. Sometimes, meshes are produced with duplicated vertices
description, making it impossible to establish some advanced conectivities. This is intrinsically the case for e.g. in
GDF files, the input mesh file format of `Wamit <http://www.wamit.com/>`_ where faces are internally represented by
vertices coordinates only, without using a connectivity table.

Sometimes also, faces normals are not consistent. This is often the case by e.g. when using `gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`_
mesh generator. You may also want to flip every normals.

Removing duplicate vertices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :abbr:`-md (--merge-duplicates)` option does this::

    >$ meshmagick coque.gdf -md

that gives:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/coque.gdf -md

This allows to generate connectivity tables in the mesh and may drastically reduce the mesh size in memory and on disk.

Healing normals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is obtained by using the :abbr:`-hn (--heal-normals)` command line option. Let's have an example. In the
`meshmagick/tests/data` folder, you can find the file ``cylinder.geo`` that is a geometry file using the GMSH
language for modeling geometry. It models the eight of a cylinder.

If you have gmsh on your computer, you can generate a mesh file from this file by issuing the
following command in your terminal::

    >$ gmsh -2 cylinder.geo

It will generate a file named ``cylinder.msh`` which is a surface mesh of the portion of cylinder. One thing that you
can do is to visualize this mesh with the `--show` option::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh --show

and stroke ``n`` to watch normals.

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_msh_normals.png

It is clear that gmsh did not orient the normals consistently. Now, you can heal them by issuing by e.g.::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh -hn -o cylinder_healed.vtp --show

which heals the normals, opens the Meshmagick's viewer and writes the healed mesh as a Paraview file.

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_msh_normals_healed.png



.. note::

    This option uses a `flood fill algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill>`_ to diffuse the normal
    orientation information. For doing so, it requires to establish a connectivity map for faces/faces adjacency. For
    this map to be realized, it is necessary to merge duplicate nodes before healing normals. When invoking the
    :abbr:`-md (--merge-duplicates)` and :abbr:`-hn (--heal-normals)` options at the same time, merging is done
    before healing so it is verified.

.. warning::

    If your mesh is not conformal, this option **may** fail as the connectivity map used by the flooding algorithm
    **may** present some non connected patches of faces that will be flooded independently, making the transit of
    normal orientation between these patch impossible.

.. note::

    If the mesh is closed and conformal, a side effect of this option is to test if the normals are outgoing and
    correct them if they are not. This is achieved by "plunging the mesh in water" and integrate the hydrostatics
    pressure to identify the resultant force orientation which must be along the positive vertical in case the
    normals are outgoing. If the mesh does not allow this checking, normals are nevertheless made consistent and you are
    warned about the eventual need to manually watch the normals from the Meshmagick's viewer and issue a new command
    to flip the whole normals as described in the following.

Flipping normals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This can be done with the :abbr:`-fn (--flip-normals)` option. Based on the ``cylinder.vtp`` file obtained just
before, if we issue the following command::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.vtp -fn --show

we get:

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_msh_normals_flipped.png

Global healing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When getting a mesh file from somewhere, you could use the :abbr:`-hm (--heal-mesh)` option to automatically apply a
set of sanity checks and modifications on the mesh. It successively applies the following operations:

* Removes unused vertices
* Removes degenerated faces
* Merge duplicate vertices
* Heal triangles description
* Heal normal orientations

The command is then::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh -hm

that outputs:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/cylinder.msh -hm

Mesh transformations
--------------------

Some basic mesh transformation options are available: translations, rotations, scaling.

Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The options to use are :abbr:`-tx (--translatex)`, :abbr:`-ty (--translatey)`, :abbr:`-tz (--translatez)`,
:abbr:`-t (--translate)` which respectively performs translations along the x axis, the y axis, the z axis and along a
coordinate vector. The invocations are::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -tx 10
    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -ty 10
    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -tz 10

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -t 10 10 10 -i

for translations of 10 along specific axes and along the coordinate vector (10, 10, 10). The last command gives:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp -t 10 10 10 -i

Rotations
~~~~~~~~~

The options to use are :abbr:`-rx (--rotatex)`, :abbr:`-ry (--rotatey)`, :abbr:`-rz (--rotatez)`,
:abbr:`-r (--rotate)` which respectively performs rotations around the x axis, the y axis, the z axis and a 3D
rotation along fixed axis rotation vector. The invocations are::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -rx 90
    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -ry 90
    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -rz 90

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -r 90 90 90 -i

for rotations of 90Â° around specific axes and around the rotation coordinate vector (90, 90, 90). The last command
gives:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp -r 90 90 90 -i

.. warning::

    * When using the :abbr:`-r (--rotate)` option, please keep in mind that the angles given are not the Cardan angles
      (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) but angles around a fixed rotation axis.
    * Angles must be given in degrees.

Scaling
~~~~~~~

The options to use are :abbr:`-sx (--scalex)`, :abbr:`-sy (--scaley)`, :abbr:`-sz (--scalez)`,
:abbr:`-s (--scale)` which respectively performs scaling along the x axis, the y axis, the z axis and a 3D
scaling of the mesh. The invocations are::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -sx 2
    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -sy 2
    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -sz 2

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -s 2 -i

for scaling of 2 along specific axes and of the whole mesh in space. The last command gives:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp -s 2 -i

.. warning::

    Scaling is performed before any translations when both options are used. So the translation magnitudes must be
    adapted to be consistent with the new scale of the mesh.

Triangulating quadrangles
-------------------------

The :abbr:`-tq (--triangulate-quadrangles)` allows to split every quadrangle faces in the mesh into two triangle::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh -tq --show

that displays the following:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/cylinder.msh -tq

.. image:: ../img/triangulate.png

.. warning::

    The splitting procedure is basic and keep in mind that no check is done on the quality of the generated triangles.
    If your mesh faces does not have a good aspect ratio, it could produce some really tiny triangles.

Working with planes
-------------------

Planes may be used in different situation as seen below. They can be defined so as to perform mesh clipping (useful
to provide the submerged part of the mesh to hydrodynamics BEM software such as Nemoh), symmetrizing (when only a
part of the mesh has been generated as in the ``cylinder.geo`` gmsh geometry file example) or mirroring.

A plane is defined by its normal :math:`\vec{n}` and a scalar parameter :math:`c` following the equation
:math:`\vec{n}.\vec{x} = c`, where :math:`\vec{x}` is the coordinate vector of a point belonging to the plane.

The scalar parameter :math:`c` is practically the orthogonal distance between the origin of the reference frame and
the plane.

Working with planes is quite flexible as you have 3 mean to use them along with plane dependent options:

* Defining the plane by 4 scalars:  :math:`n_x, n_y, n_z, c`
* Using predefined plane keywords:
    - Oxy
    - Oxz
    - Oyz
    - /Oxy
    - /Oxz
    - /Oyz
* Using the index of a plane that has been defined with the :abbr:`-p (--plane)` option.

Defining planes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A plane may be defined at the command line level along with de :abbr:`-p (--plane)` option::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -p 0 0 1 0

defines the plane with normal (0, 0, 1) and the scalar parameter 0.

It is also possible to define the same plane by a predefined keyword argument::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -p Oxy

Predefined keywords arguments are Oxy, Oxz, Oyz, /Oxy, /Oxz, /Oyz and are self descriptive. The slash indicates that
the normals is reversed.

It is possible to define several planes at once such as in::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -p Oxy -p /Oxz

When defining planes with the :abbr:`-p (--plane)` option, the planes definitions are internally stored in a list in
the order that you used in the command line and it is then possible to refer to them in other options by their index in
the list, starting by 0. So in the above command line, the plane Oxy can be refereed as the plane index 0 and the /Oxz
plane as the plane index 1.

Clipping a mesh by a plane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To clip a mesh against a plane, use the :abbr:`-c (--clip)` option like in::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -c 1 1 1 2 --show

that displays the following view:

.. image:: ../img/clip.png

As said before, the above command is strictly equivalent to::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -p 1 1 1 2 -c 0 --show

It is also possible to use several :abbr:`-c (--clip)` option at a time::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -c Oxy -c Oyz --show

that gives:

.. image:: ../img/clip2.png

.. note::

    It is possible to invoke the :abbr:`-c (--clip)` option without any argument. In that case, a default Oxy plane
    is taken.

.. note::

    The part of the mesh that is kept is that opposite to the plane's normal orientation.

Symmetrizing a mesh about a plane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To symmetrize a mesh about a plane, use the :abbr:`--sym (--symmetrize)` option. Taking back the ``cylinder.msh``
example generated sooner, we can issue::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh --sym Oxy --show

that gives:

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_sym.png

Combining the options allow us to close the cylinder::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh --sym Oxy --sym Oxz --sym Oyz --show

that gives:

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_sym3.png

Checking normals gives as expected:

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_sym3_normals.png

that we can heal::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh --sym Oxy --sym Oxz --sym Oyz -hn --show

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_sym3_normals_healed.png

and clip back::

    >$ meshmagick cylinder.msh --sym Oxy --sym Oxz --sym Oyz -hn -c Oxy -c Oyz -c Oxz --show

making us confident with respect to the normal consistency and orientation (outward) of our open part of cylinder mesh:

.. image:: ../img/cylinder_sym3_normals_healed_clip.png

.. note::

    Faces quality on the vicinity of the clipping plane is not checked. You can then generate faces with very poor
    aspect ratio. This will be fixed in a future Meshmagick's release by applying a projection procedure that is
    nontrivial to develop as it must not modify the geometry locally.


Getting inertial properties of the mesh
---------------------------------------

Meshmagick allows to calculate inertial properties of meshes based on some assumptions on the mass distribution:

* A mesh which is **uniformly filled** with an homogeneous medium with a given density (the practical interest if for
  e.g. for ballast modeling).
* A mesh considered as a **shell** having a constant thickness and made in a medium of a given density (approximation
  for floating structures).

.. todo::

    Ajouter des mots clÃ© pour les matÃ©riaux dispos

.. warning::

    * **Inertial properties** are:

        * The **mass** :math:`m` (tons)
        * The position of the **center of gravity** in the mesh's reference frame :math:`\vec{OG}`
        * The (3x3) symmetric 3D rotational **inertia matrix** :math:`\mathbf{I}_O`

    * The inertia matrix must be expressed with respect to a *reduction point*. Internally, inertia calculations are
      done in the mesh's reference frame (where vertices coordinates are expressed) so **the default inertia matrix is
      expressed at the mesh's origin**. Please see the ``--reduction-point`` and ``--at-cog`` options to specify an
      other reduction point.

    * Note also that the default unit for mass in Meshmagick is the ton ! This is of practical use in offshore
      applications.

Defining the medium density
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The medium density, for both assumptions on mass distribution in the mesh, is done by using the ``--rho-medium``
option::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp --rho-medium 1023

.. note::

   Density must be given in kg/m**3 unit.

.. note::

    In the above command line, we specified a meshfile as an option although we have no mesh processing at all, the
    aim being to get the list of available medium. This is a limitation of the ``argparse`` Python module that is
    used in Meshmagick to parse command line options and arguments. This module does not allow to define optional
    arguments that overhelms the mandatoriness of the positional arguments. Except for the ``--help`` command line
    option, you always have to specify a mesh file while calling Meshmagick.

It is also possible to use some default medium density keywords. These keywords can be retrieved using the
``--list-medium`` option::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp --list-medium

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp --list-medium

An other solution is to look at the ``--help`` output.

.. todo::

    * Faire que argparse Ã©mette un warning si on a des options non reconnues.
    * Ajouter la possibilitÃ© d'exprimer les matrices rÃ©sultat en un point de rÃ©duction particulier. Cette option
      qu'on nomera --reduction-point (-rp) sera utilisee a la fois par les inerties et par la matrice raideur
    * On mettra aussi en place une option --at-cog pour que le poitn de reduction soit specifie au cetre de gravite


Guessing the mesh is filled with homogeneous medium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is achieved by using the :abbr:`-pi (--plain-inertia)` option::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -pi --rho-medium 800

that gives:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp -pi --rho-medium 800

.. note::
    If the medium's density is not specified, the ``-pi`` option guesses that the medium is salt water and then takes a
    default density of 1023 kg/m**3.

Guessing the mesh is a shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is achieved by using the :abbr:`-si (--shell-inertia)` option::

    >$ meshmagick SEAREV.vtp -si --rho-medium 5850 --thickness 0.02

that gives:

.. program-output:: python ../meshmagick/meshmagick.py ../meshmagick/tests/data/SEAREV.vtp -si --rho-medium 5850
                    --thickness 0.02

.. note::

    * If the ``--rho-medium`` option is not specified, the medium density is by default considered that of steel (5850
      kg/m**3)
    * If the ``--thickness`` option is not specified, the thickness of the shell is by default considered being 0.02
      meters.
